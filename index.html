<P> I have worked for Quality Control
    systems in different production
    factories for years.  I have managed all
    these works with a background in
    implementing and developing
    improvement processes through
    collaboration with multidisciplinary
    systems. Right now I am majoring at
    Computer Science and I think, it is my
    best decision which I have ever made.
    Having programming, data analysis
    and software skills are my new goals. I
    have always been ambitious target
   oriented about my goals and
    expectations. I am good at being
    problem solver and identify the core
    of the problems. So I believe merging
    all my degrees and my master will
    open a new perspective to me. </P>
